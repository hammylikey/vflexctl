vflexctl
########################

An unofficial cli for setting the voltage on VFLEX devices with MIDI control

Why? I dunno, I like the idea of being able to work this without needing a website?

############
Installation
############

(Once this is ready and published) it can be installed using pipx, using:

```
pipx install vflexctl
```

############
Usage
############

Coming soon, I need to actually write the way you use this


##############
Current state
##############

Early testing has this able to read and set the voltage, read the LED state, and get the serial number.

The plan is that this will work as long as you only have *one* inserted. Unless it's extremely important, building selection is more work than what's needed.
